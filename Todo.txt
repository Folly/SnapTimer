What to do when time is up        
    Blink the time
    Shake the window http://delphi.about.com/od/adptips2005/qt/windowshake.htm (set how many seconds)
    Bring app to front
    Play system beep (MessageBeep(-1); in MMSystem, http://sheepdogguides.com/dt2g.htm
    Restart or shutdown windows (can they already do this by running a command?)

Option to restore defaults (equivalent of deleting the .ini file)                

Implement compact mode - show just the time without buttons or menus
    Have setting so it opens in that mode.

Keyboard shortcuts
    Global shortcut to show window (configurable)

Allow setting of hours or seconds as an option?

Change the text to look like a digital clock instead of plain text
    Use images for the numbers? 
    Draw the numbers on a canvas
    It would keep text from shifting slightly when a 1 goes in the minutes' tens place.  If that bothers you, use a monospace font

Add an analog mode that shows a clock face and draw the hands going around

Test with different font sizes (huge fonts, small fonts)
    
Add progress bar that counts up until it's done

Steve Pavlina's newsletter to do 15 minute chunks
30 minutes of uninterrupted work for the Now Habit
2 minutes of relaxing to get ready for a task

Make stopwatch mode show tenths of seconds instead of just seconds?
Have option to show tenths of seconds for timer mode too

Look at http://gtd-timer.com/moreinfo.htm for settings and ideas

Make it an option to hide the menu bar

Fix settings dialog to look okay with large text (best practice for that sort of thing?)

Create themes to choose from (color combinations that look good)

Allow creation of saved settings for timers - alarm method and countdown time
Different .ini file for each setting, load the ini file from command line?    

Run notifications at a certain clock time instead of when the timer reaches 0

Make dialogs not show up in taskbar (so nothing appears if the main form is minimized to tray and you open about page or options) I set ShowInTaskBar to stNever, but it still shows up.

When font size changes, I should be able to automatically resize the window using the viewable rectangle to show all the text.  If I set the form's AutoSize to true, it works on startup (but could use some tweaks), but I can't seem to get it to work after the options dialog is displayed.  What about creating a simple example to see if I can get it to resize the form?  What about using vector graphics?
What about drawing with the font?

Change start/pause images into an image list TImageList - resizing seems to be messing this up a bit, so it would be good to do

Maximize window and display about or options dialogs, window should remain maximized after dialog is closed.

If two windows are open and always on top mode is set, they get into a fight - stop it somehow?

Start using version control of some sort

Write unit tests

Goals for next release
* Automatic resize with font change - if it proves too challenging, what about drawing the fonts on a canvas? (post on lazarus forum for help, resize works on startup, how can I get it to work after font size change?)
* Get rid of flickering with large fonts (post on lazarus forum for help)
* start/pause one image (Timagelist)

You can draw your clock-style digits with narrow hexagons (TCanvas.Polygon)
